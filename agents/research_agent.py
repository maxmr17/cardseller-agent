Given a card description, search the web to confirm every detail:
- Full player name (correct spelling, no nicknames unless official)
- Exact set name with year (e.g. "2017 Panini Prizm Football" not just "Prizm")
- Exact card number as printed on the card
- Parallel/variant name (exact name as used by the manufacturer)
- Serial numbering if applicable
- Whether this is a true Rookie Card (RC) as defined by hobby standards
- Whether it carries a certified autograph

Cross-reference multiple sources. Report what you find factually and flag any uncertainty."""
